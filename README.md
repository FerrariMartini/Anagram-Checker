- Gave words are considered anagram when both of them have the same letters.

  - E.g:
    - True => word01 = "Sapiens" | word02 = "Snepisa"
    - False => word01 = "Sapienx" | word02 = "Snepisa"

- Gave words are considered anagram when both of them have the same quantity of letter's number of times
  - E.g:
    - True => word01 = "Sapiens" | word02 = "Snepisa"
    - False => word01 = "Sapien" | word02 = "Snepisa"

# Technical Requeriment
- You do not use sort method

# Start the project:

Using a NodeJS:

- Make sure you have NodeJS installed and set up in you machine;
- Run the index script using the command `node index.js`;

Using a Browser Inspect:

- Copy the content of index.js script and paste into this website https://onecompiler.com/javascript/

# Technical concepts

The complexity of this will be 0(n).

```
Five Big O run times that youâ€™ll encounter a lot, sorted from fastest to slowest:
- O(log n), also known as log time. Example: Binary search.
- O(n), also known as linear time. Example: Simple search.
- O(n * log n). Example: A fast sorting algorithm, like quicksort.
- O(n2). Example: A slow sorting algorithm, like selection sort.
- O(n!). Example: A really slow algorithm, like the travelling salesperson.
